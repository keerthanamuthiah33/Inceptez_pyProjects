"""
A set is an unordered collection of items.
Set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.
Every element is unique (no duplicates)
Every element inside a set must be immutable canâ€™t put lists or dictionaries inside a set, 
but you can put tuples, numbers, or strings).

In Python sets are written with curly brackets.
